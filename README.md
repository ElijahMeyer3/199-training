- Why this position matters ([paper-1])(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41979-020-00031-1)

"Several of the factors that contribute to STEM retention relate to how faculty teach and the messages they send. Notably, more than 90% of students who left STEM majors mentioned concern about the poor quality of teaching in their introductory college courses (Seymour and Hewitt, 1997). Moreover, large introductory STEM courses have a reputation of being “weed-out” courses that focus on lecture (Mervis, 2011). Students in passive lecture courses report general dissatisfaction with the classroom environment, lack of structure, and impersonal nature of their courses (Cooper and Robinson, 2000).

Several national reports have called for universities to move away from lecture and incorporate active learning into undergraduate STEM courses (American Association for the Advancement of Science, 2011; President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, 2012). Active-learning practices such as peer instruction with clicker questions or small-group work have been shown to be more effective for student learning and engagement than solely lecturing in college classrooms (Haak et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2011; Freeman et al., 2014). Furthermore, incorporating active learning in the classroom has been found to increase equitable outcomes for URM and first-generation students and decrease student failure rates (Stephens et al., 2012; Eddy and Hogan, 2014; Ballen et al., 2017; Gavassa et al., 2019). In addition to improving student learning outcomes, active-learning approaches positively impact student retention. For example, peer instruction (Mazur, 1997) in physics courses resulted in both increased student learning outcomes and persistence of students in STEM majors when compared with traditional lecturing (Crouch and Mazur, 2002; Watkins and Mazur, 2019).

Despite the call for incorporating active learning into classrooms, lecture is still the predominant instructional practice in college STEM courses regardless of course level or class size (Akiha et al., 2018; Stains et al., 2018). This focus on lecture in college classrooms differs significantly from instructional practices used in high school classes (Akiha et al., 2018). A study characterizing how class time was spent in 480 middle school, high school, first-year college, and advanced college classrooms found that the median percent of 2-minute class intervals spent lecturing shifted from 32% in high school to 80% in first-year college classes (Akiha et al., 2018). Students in middle and high school courses spent more time working individually or in groups on in-class activities. The shift from high school to first-year college is the most dramatic instructional transition students experience between starting middle school and finishing college." - [Meaders et al., 2019](https://www.lifescied.org/doi/full/10.1187/cbe.19-05-0084)

## The WHAT and WHY 

If you can articulate why we use Quarto, students are more likely to "buy in" and learn it!

- Reproduciability 

- Collaboration 

- Quarto supports many languages such as R, Python, Julia, etc. 


## Quarto vs R-Markdown 

Rmarkdown:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)  
```

Quarto:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
title: "Project Title" 
execute:
  echo: false

```

Quarto: easier to get started and attempts to "smooth" the edges of R-markdown

## Visual vs Source Tab

::: {#fig-R2 layout-ncol="2"}
![](images/source2.png){#fig-s}

![](images/visual2.png){#fig-v}

Source (a) vs Visual (b)

These are not obvious questions to those who have never coded before

-- How to Render a document 

-- What is a YAML

-- Where to write code

-- Where to write text

## "My Document won't Render"

Throughout the semester, you will be asked a variety of Quarto questions from students.

We are going to practice: 

-- Identifying errors 

-- Fixing errors 

-- **How we teach these fixes to students**

Goal: Helping students become learners.... not fixing the errors for them 

# exercise1 

# Questions?

# exercise2 

# Questions?

## Other Common Mistakes 

-- Saving variables

-- Overwriting variables / data sets 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

data <- data |>
  summarize(mean(col1))

```

-- Missing `|>`

-- `==` vs `%in%`

## In Summary 

Discovery 

-- Help students help themselves 

-- Show patience

-- Use informative error messages

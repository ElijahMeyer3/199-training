# Introductions 

## Outline 

-- Teaching

    --- Active Learning 
    --- Interacting with Students 

-- Quarto

    --- How we teach Quarto in 199
    --- Common Student Mistakes

## During the workshop 

This is a space to talk and think critically about teaching

-- Breakout rooms 

-- Group discussions

-- Activities 


## TAs Matter{.center}

*"Several of the factors that contribute to STEM retention relate to how faculty teach and the messages they send. Notably, more than 90% of students who left STEM majors mentioned concern about the poor quality of teaching in their introductory college courses" [@seymour1997]*

## How to send the right message 

What message do we want to send?

What are some strategies we can use to send the right message? 

- Message: We care & want them to be successful 

- Be on time (lab + office hours)

- Communicate with your students 

- Be approachable 

## Approachability

**Breakout Room (~5 minutes)**

Recall an instructor who you felt comfortable approaching during lab/office hours and one who you did not. Why were you comfortable approaching the one teacher, but not the other?

# Discussion

## Approachability (Key Take-Aways)

How and what we communicate <span style="color:blue;">verbally</span> and <span style="color:blue;">non-verbally</span> matter!

It’s not only what you say, but also <span style="color:blue;">how</span> you communicate it

Difficult situations will arise when interacting with students.

-- How we respond verbally and non-verbally matters!

-- Instructors will handle different situations differently 

-- Be flexible and adapt to the situation and context you encounter.
     
## Other practical 199 tips

-- Support each other & the instructor  

-- Do not promise points to students

-- Follow up with students

## TAs are Teachers 

You are not just an answer key...

-- You teach students during lab 

-- You teach students during office hours

-- ... and how you teach matters!


## How you teach matters{.center}

*Students being taught using passive lecture techniques report general dissatisfaction with the overall learning environment, lack of structure, and impersonal nature of their courses [@cooper2000]* 

## Active Learning{.center} 

*"Several national reports have called for universities to move away from lecture and incorporate active learning into undergraduate STEM courses" [@american2011vision; @olson2012engage]*


# What is active learning?

## Active Learning{.smaller}

My definition: **Discovery based learning** where the instructor uses sets of techniques that involve students in the learning process. 

Where the learning process is a shared responsibility between the instructor and student. 

-- Any technique that actively engages students in the material

"Active learning, in contrast, is grounded in constructivist theory, which holds that humans learn by actively using new information and experiences to modify their existing models of how the world works" [@Theobald2020]

## National Recommendations 

Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education

Use active learning

-- Teach statistics as an investigative process of problem-solving and decision making.
        
-- Give students experience with multivariable thinking.
        
-- Focus on conceptual understanding.

[@wood]

## More reasons to care

Setting students up for future academic success

-- Increased assessment scores; decreased failure rates [@freeman]

-- Improved critical thinking skills [@nelson]

-- Problem solving skills [@gleason]

## In Lab & Office Hours

How could active learning be incorporated? 

- Answering questions with questions 

- Allow for mistakes

- Help students discover material

- Facilitating group conversation 

- Assigning roles to students in groups 

## Key Take-Aways

-- Active learning looks different in different classrooms and for different instructors ... and that’s okay!

-- Adapt active learning to fit who you are as an instructor!
      
## Key Take-Aways

Implementation Matters!

-- Using a particular strategy does not guarantee students are actively engaged in the material ... it’s more about how you use a strategy than what the strategy is itself.

## Key Take-Aways

Transparency is key!

-- Students are more likely to "buy-in" when they understand *why* you are using some of the strategies you are

## Research Based Recommendations 

Make time for teaching

-- Habitual reflection and self-evaluation 

-- Classroom observations

-- Formal interactions (discuss teaching in weekly meetings)

-- Informal interactions (discuss teaching with each other)
